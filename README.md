# ESP32 Controller ðŸŽ®
This is a project that uses a PS4 controller combined with a FREENOVE ESP32-WROOM and breakout board. It allows the user to use a PS4 controller to control outputs on the FREENOVE breakout board. Other controllers can be used, button assignments may need to be changed. When flashing the board select '_ESP32-WROOM-DA Module_' from the list of available boards manager. 

Once flashed the PS4 controller can be paired by pressing and holding the playstation logo and share button simultaneously.

Features:
- Users can trim the joystick position using R1 and L1 combined with the D-pad to trim the left and right joystick. This is implemented in the `GamepadController.cpp`. The remote should vibrate to indicate the trim is being adjusted.

        L1 + D-pad Left will trim the left joystick left

- Users can upload a .wav audio file to the SD card. The file name called in the example can be changed in the `Audioplayer.cpp`. The current example will loop the current audio file selected when you press X on the PS4 controller.
